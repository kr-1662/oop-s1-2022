1. It is a common practice to use the first line of the commit message as a subject line, similar to an email. The rest of the log message is considered the body and used to communicate details of the commit change set.

2. Capitalization and Punctuation: Capitalize the first word and do not end in punctuation. If using Conventional Commits, remember to use all lowercase. Mood: Use imperative mood in the subject line. Also be specific about the updates that's happening

3. Depends on your work, if you're a student probably every 2-3 days

4. I don't think we should commit our binary and obj files and images, log files etc.
